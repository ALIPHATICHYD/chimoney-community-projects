# How Global Payout Platforms Can Empower Communities and Non-profits

You’re hosting a charity baking event, raising funds to help an underserved community overseas gain access to 24/7 electricity and clean water. After reaching your monetary goal, you send the money using a platform like PayPal, feeling accomplished. But a few days later, when you check for updates, there's no clear sign that the funds have reached the community. The excitement of making a difference turns into frustration and uncertainty. A possible solution to this issue is using Chimoney. The platform allows global payouts to 130+ countries via the recipient's email and in this case the community you're sending to will be able to redeem the received payment to their own registered bank account, or mobile money instantly depending on their location. This article explores how global payout platforms can empower non-profits and community initiatives, using Chimoney as a solution to streamlining international transfers.

## How Global Payout Platforms Offer Transparency and Save You Money

Non-profits often face a common challenge when using traditional banking to send funds overseas: these platforms typically charge high fees for transactions and require additional payments to access many of their services. For example, [just last year alone, nonprofits collectively spent approximately $3 billion on transaction fees.](https://www.zeffy.com/blog/nonprofits-paid-2-billion-in-transaction-fees-last-year). In other words, traditional banking platforms can be prohibitively expensive. Unlike traditional banks, Chimoney offers transparent and affordable payment rates, with clearly disclosed fees, making it easier for nonprofits to plan and budget their funding effectively. The platform was founded by [Uchi Uchibeke, who experienced firsthand the high fees of traditional banking while trying to send prize money to winners of AfriHacks, a hackathon he was hosting.](https://chimoney.io/blogs/techstars-backs-chimoney-to-revolutionize-global-payouts/) With Chimoney, he was able to pay the winners without hidden fees. And transparent fees are just one way that global payouts can empower your nonprofit or community initiative. Let’s explore another advantage.

## Overcome Geographical Barriers with Global Payout Platforms
Another common issue that nonprofits and community initiatives face when it comes to sending funds overseas is restrictions that limit them to certain countries. This limitation can be especially challenging for organizations whose mission is to provide aid to those in need, regardless of location. Unlike traditional banks, global payout platforms like [Chimoney enable transactions in over 130 countries worldwide](https://chimoney.io/payouts/), giving nonprofits the freedom to support their intended recipients wherever they are. With this capability, nonprofits can overcome geographical barriers and better fulfill their mission.

## How Global Payout Platforms Can Make Your Transactions Quick

It may sound cliché, but "time is money" truly applies when it comes to getting funds where they’re needed—on time. Unfortunately, traditional banks often have limited transfer windows, especially for international transactions, as they [must follow country-specific protocols](https://tipalti.com/resources/learn/global-payouts/#the-challenges-that-face-global-payouts). For instance, Bank of America customers who need to send international transfers can only do so [by 5:00 pm Eastern Time](https://www.bankofamerica.com/help/cutoff-times/), and they [must use SWIFT codes](https://info.bankofamerica.com/en/digital-banking/wire-transfers), which can add [delays to the process](https://meestpay.com/what-is-swift-money-transfer-and-its-disadvantages/). These restrictions can hinder nonprofits by delaying the vital funds needed for their communities.

Global payout platforms like Chimoney offer fast delivery and 24/7 payment processing, allowing nonprofits to make quick, reliable transfers across borders. This means no waiting for banking hours or dealing with restrictive protocols—funds reach recipients quickly. For example, [AfricaHacks uses Chimoney's bulk payout feature to reward hackathon winners](https://chimoney.io/blogs/5-types-of-people-who-should-use-chimoneys-bulk-gift-cards-feature/). With just one click, all winners receive their payouts instantly, redeemable via bank transfers, mobile money, airtime, or gift cards.

Now, before you go, there’s just one more benefit of using global payout platforms like Chimoney for nonprofit funding.

## How Global Payout Platforms Can Give You Multiple Ways To Send Money

Even though traditional banks provide ways to send money, their options are often limited. For instance, [Bank of America only allows users to send money internationally via its website or mobile app](https://info.bankofamerica.com/en/digital-banking/wire-transfers), while some local banks require in-person visits. This setup can be a challenge for nonprofits, as the communities they serve may lack access to these specific channels or may not have these banks in their country.

In contrast, global payout platforms like Chimoney offer a wider range of transfer methods, allowing nonprofits to choose the delivery method that best meets the needs of their organization and recipients. For example, through Chimoney’s partnership with the [International Student Identity Card (ISIC), students can manage their finances more easily](https://chimoney.io/blogs/chimoney-partners-with-isic-to-expand-global-benefits-for-chimoney-app-users/) and send or receive funds through email, or within Chimoney app.

Now that you know the advantages of global payout systems, let’s explore how Chimoney's platform can further empower nonprofits and communities.
