## Why Seamless Payouts Matter for Digital Marketplaces

Digital marketplaces act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, connecting them in a way that benefits everyone. Whether your platform focuses on products or services, handling both incoming payments from customers and outgoing payouts to your users is crucial.

Here’s why seamless payouts are important:

- **Boosts User Trust**: Sellers and service providers need fast and secure payouts. If payments are delayed or fail, users may lose trust in your platform and look for alternatives.
- **Supports Global Reach**: Running a global marketplace means dealing with multiple currencies, local payment methods, and tax regulations across different countries. A reliable payout system simplifies these challenges, allowing you to operate efficiently worldwide.
- **Helps You Scale**: As your marketplace grows, manual payouts become impractical. Automating payments with a flexible and reliable system ensures that your platform can handle more users without additional stress.

## Common Payout Challenges for Marketplaces

Managing payouts on a global scale isn’t without its challenges. Some of the most common issues include:

1. **Currency and Exchange Rates**: Users in different countries often need payouts in their local currencies. Converting currencies can result in poor exchange rates and fees, making the payout less valuable for your users.
2. **Tax Compliance**: Cross-border transactions come with tax obligations. Platforms need to ensure compliance with various tax regulations, which can be complicated when managing global payouts.

3. **Payment Preferences**: Different regions favor different payment methods. Offering limited payout options might alienate users from certain areas, making your platform less appealing globally.

4. **Delayed Payments**: International payments can take days or even weeks to process. This delay frustrates users and can make your marketplace less competitive.

## Example Code: Making a Payout Request

Here’s a simple code sample demonstrating how to make a payout request using Chimoney’s API:

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

const data = {
  amount: 100,
  currency: "USD",
  recipient: {
    email: "user@example.com",
    method: "bank_transfer",
    bank_account: {
      account_number: "1234567890",
      routing_number: "012345678",
      swift_code: "CHASUS33",
    },
  },
};

axios
  .post("https://api.chimoney.io/v1/payouts", data, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`,
    },
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log("Payout successful:", response.data);
  })
