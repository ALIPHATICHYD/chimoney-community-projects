# **Top 3 Challenges Companies Face When Paying Freelancers Globally (And How to Solve Them)** 
by **Ifeoluwa Favour**

The freelance economy has experienced a boom in the last five years as COVID-19 measures greatly influenced the freelance economy by leading to a rise in remote work, making businesses become familiar with hiring remote workers.

The surging numbers tell the story. Over one-third of the U.S. workforce identifies as independent workers according to [Wripple](https://www.wripple.com/insights/wripples-2024-team-up-report-highlights). The [Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KvK)](https://www.kvk.nl/en/) says that the number of freelancers in the Netherlands has increased by 85% over the past decade. Today, the Netherlands is home to 1.6 million freelancers.

The freelance economy is constantly evolving. However, it has its benefits as well as challenges. One of those challenges is making international payments to freelancers. From regulatory compliance to payment delays to high cost of transfer fees, this is a challenge many companies need to overcome to benefit from the global talent pool of freelancers.

This article discusses challenges companies face when making payments to freelancers globally and how to solve these challenges.

## **Top 3 Challenges Companies Face When Paying Freelancers Globally**  
1.  **Regulatory compliance**
In order to prevent issues such as fraud, and maintain transparency in financial dealings, every country has set financial regulations that govern international payments.

A slight mistake in adherence to these regulations can result in substantial fines. For instance, in 2023, [JPMorgan Chase faced a $98.2 million penalty](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/enforcement20240314a.htm) for inadequate monitoring of firm and client trading activities, including failure to adhere to international payment and tax regulations​​.

2.  **High Transfer Fees**
Transferring money to different countries can incur extra costs like high processing fees. Sometimes $300 payments can cost up to $60 in commissions.

The cost of transfer fees usually depends on the solution used to make the payment transfers. The best payment option will save your business extra unnecessary costs.

3.  **Slow Transaction Time**
Timely payments are also an issue. Depending on the method of transfer, payments can take anywhere from 24 hours to even 5 days to process, and if the sum is big, freelancers get worried about fraud or non-payment, hurting the company's or business' reputation.

Newer payment options now significantly reduce the time freelancers have to wait to receive payment, relieving both the company or business and the freelancers of unnecessary troubles.
